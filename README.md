# Modulation
Modulation is a fundamental process in communication systems that enables the transmission of
information or data over long distances. The original data (message signal) is often too weak to
be transmitted directly through a channel. To address this, it is combined with a high-frequency,
strong signal called the carrier signal, which acts as a medium to carry the message signal, such as
sound, images, or data.
Here I've designed ASK and FSK modulation systems.
